### Authors:
Fam le Kien, P. Schneeweiss, A. Rauschenbeutel

### Reference

## Purpose

The general state of the literature concerning the theory of atom-light interactions uses inconsistent notation and is often unclear in their definitions. This paper computes the dynamical polarizability in general and in the specific case of the ground state of Cesium (and the fictitious magnetic field) systematically with consistent notation.

## Context

Obviously, it's of interest to calculate polarizabilities - to find tuneouts and magic wavelength for state-dependent traps, etc etc. 

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution



## Relevance

Explain how this paper is relevant to your project and what you are trying to get out of the paper. Does it suggest other papers you should read, or give you new information you need?

## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions


## Notes

### General theory

Fix a Cartesian reference frame with quantization axis $z$.
The authors consider an atom with nuclear spin $\textbf{I}$, while Helium has $\textbf{I}=0$. Still, let's follow for elucidation.
Hyperfine interactions $\imply$ electronic angular momentum $\textbf{J}$ is not conserved (as the Hamiltonian picks up the $V^{hfs}$ term, equation (1)). But $\textbf{F} = \textbf{J} + \textbf{I}$ *is* conserved, and the $V^{hfs}$ operator is diagonal in the $|nJFM\rangle$ basis, where $n$ is the set of all quantum mumbers $\{nLSI}$.
#### AC stark effect
Consider a classical light fields
$$
\textbf{E} = \frac{1}{2}\textbf{\mathcal{E}}e^{i\omega t} + \textrm{c.c.} = \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}\textbf{u}}e^{i\omega t} + \textrm{c.c.}
$$
Where $\textbf{\mathcal{E}} = \mathcal{E}\textbf{u}$ is the positive-frequency electric field envelope with amplitude and polarization vector $\mathcal{E},\textbf{u}$. The former is a complex scalar, the latter a complex unit vector.
