## Purpose

The authors measure a tuneout wavelength in the $F=2$ ground state of Rubidium. I am reading this paper to understand how they treat the relation between the lightfield vector and the magnetic field vector.

## Context

The precision of this measurement brings it into the realm where QED, the Breit interaction, hyperfine interactions, and core-valence electron correlations become relevant, as a test for atomic structure theory.

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution

Describe their results and conclusions, assess how they fit into the field

## Relevance

Reproducing the expression provided by Li-Yan in page 2;
"The energy shift can be expressed as
$$
U = -\frac{\langle E^2\rangle}{2} \Big(\alpha^{(0)}-\mathcal{V}\cos\chi \frac{m_F}{F}\alpha^{(1)} + \Big(\frac{3\cos^2\xi -1}{2}\Big)\frac{3m_f^2-F(F-1)}{F(2F-1)}\alpha^{(2)}\Big)
$$
Where $\alpha^{(i)}$ are components of polarizability (scalar, vector, tensor), the atom is in the state $|F,m_F\rangle$ relative to the field direction $\hat{b}=\textbf{B}/B$, the angle between the Stark beam k-vector and the magnetic field is $\chi$ (so $\cos\chi = \hat{k}\cdot)

"
