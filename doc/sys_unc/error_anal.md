# Error analysis

We are interested in the change in trap freq (dependent variable) versus the change in applied wavelength (independent variable). In these notes we collate our characterization of the accuracy and precision of the measurement.



## Characterized uncertainties
* Power dependence 
  * Power scan
* Spectral purity
  * filters
* Polarization dependence
  * Purity
    * QWP rotations
  * Pointing
    * HWP rotations
* Laser pointing
* Magnetic field
  * Magnitude
  * Direction
*

## TODO
* Uh, everything
* Read through code
* Statistical Error
* Systematic Error
  * Spectral analysis
  * Check MATLAB's covariance methods
  * Simulate a simple analog
  * Allen deviation:
    * signal (subscan)
    * Cs reference in WM
  * Find some good refs.
