			Summary of findings here:
				linear fit to the runs show that PD value is almost entirely responsible for slope 	variation (see F-stat and p-value)
				NB linear fit intercept consistent with zero; does quad do better?

			So this seems good; hope the slope of delta (Omega^2) to scale linearly with power
				Thus, we need the conversion factor from intensity to polarizability, but also from PD voltage into power!

				Lin model fit to all WP runs has smallest intercept, although assumed PD settings the same. 
				Can put v healthy error bars on it, like 10% or more but would need to justify
				Hence let's roll with
					d Omega_trap^2 /d f = 2e-7 P
					and then calculate our way through the constant-factor conversion

	[] S/V error bar projection
		-> is there a constrained/alternative LM that works here, given the sign/angle constraints?
			Need to do statistics on a hypercylinder....?
		Ok - we have all the plots. Just need to change some things.
		The criticism was re: the CI and error bars, namely 
			- Fig3: I am assuming that the shaded area in As hows the confidence interval, just as in fig.10 and fig.11. (BTW, I would suggest to use the same style for these confidence intervals in all the plots). If so, it seems to be too small. One would expect that 68\% of the data points are inside. Also it would be good to know what the $\chi^2$/dof for these linear fits(and for all fits) are.}
		On various kinds of intervals...

		Have to say - I am not sure this is an accurate use of the fitnlm. I suspect the parameter errors are somewhat reliable...
			Fits a model like
					%tune_out_scalar
					%reduced_vector
					%reduce_tensor
					%angle between polz measurment basis and B cross k
					% theta k

					full_tune_out_polz_model(b,x) = b(1) + (1/2).*x(:,2).*cos(b(5)).*b(2) - (1/2)*D_fun( b(5),Q_fun( x(:,1),x(:,3),b(4) ) ).*b(3);
					where
						b(3) = beta^T 
						Q_fun(contrast,theta,phi) = contrast.*cos(2.*(theta+phi));
						D_fun(theta_k,Q) = (3*(sin(theta_k)^2)*((1/2)+(Q/2)))-1;
						flipping beta_T produces a sign change in the last term which would be compensated for by a sign change in D_fun
						D_fun uses theta_k as a parameter but the sin^2 means it lives between 0 and 1... 

						I mean we do have a linear model;
						f_TO(Q,V) = const +  B V - 0.5*const*(const*(1 + Q/2)-1)
						f_TO(Q,V) = A +  0.5 B V - 0.25 C Q
						thus we can pull out some fit parameters A, B, and C from a linear fit
							the coefficients can then be used to calculate the other things
								there are covariances evidently as a lot is bundled into A
							Then we need to predict f_TO(-1,0)
						And there is this issue of the sign - we take the sign of beta^T>0
						prior method provides 'equal agreement with either sign'? equal MSE?
