TO reworking notes
	Seems like the trap freq fits are re-running, let's see if we can cache that

MAIN TASKS
	1. Convert fit gradient into polarizability est
		[] Beam power
			Check PD logs
		[] Waist size
			probably never measured again, so ballpark something
		[] Gradient conversion
			Parse code and add another output field somewhere
	2. Read magic WL papers, explain connection in thesis/paper
	3. Go through fitting procedures and figure out errorbar/CI business
