-want to calibrate how many volts needed to move the ecd resonance frequency by some ammount
- will just use the cursors on the scope before and after shifting the wm feedback freq



delta 4ghz red, 56mv in ecd voltage
fsr ~ 128 mv
gives a fsr of about 9.1429GHz

20190722T1022+1000
set_freq=TOSMHT+4ghz
newfile3.wfm
takes soooo long to save even the waveform format

set_freq=TOSMHT
newfile4.wfm


# simple finesse measurment
cavity voltage =790mv/s
pd width 310us (FWHM)
gives a width of 17.4929MHz
and then a finesse of about 522.45
