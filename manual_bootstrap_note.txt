ok i went and did a qick manual process

selecting 10% of the data
fits of of the TO (in mhz)
[362867463.14,362869124.09,362867014.24,362867656.92,362867309.59,362863025.61,362869201.65,362865901.99,362868125.63]
gives standard deviation
1.8708e+03
using the finite population correction
finite_pop_corr=sqrt((n_total-n_sample)/(n_total-1));
=0.9510
the population sd is 
1.9671e3
multiply by sqrt(0.1)
622.0488 MHz

the fit estimate with all the data
 362867661.59Â±368.52Mhz
