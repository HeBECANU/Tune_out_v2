-------------------------------------------------------------
Description

ComponentLibrary is a free, open collection of images for drawing
diagrams related to laser optics, including many optics but also
electronic components. The images are provided as vector graphics, as
Scalable Vector Graphics (svg), to be used with free tools such as
Inkscape, and in Adobe Illustrator format (ai).


Originally developed for illustrating a Diploma thesis at the
Albert-Einstein Institute in Hannover, the library has since been used
to provide diagrams and graphs for many research papers, PhD theses
and talks. If you are working with optical components or sometimes
write or give talks about science, the ComponentLibrary might be a
good starting point for creating clear and well-designed drawings to
support your work.

On http://www.gwoptics.org/component_library/
you can download the library in various formats:

- ComponentLibrary (svg): All images in a single svg file for
  convenient copy+paste, recommended with Inkscape
- ComponentLibrary (ai): Images in one Adobe Illustrator compatible
  library file
- ComponentLibrary (files): Zip file with all images as separate files
  (svg and ai)
- ComponentLibrary3_German: (Old) German manual for version 3 of
  ComponentLibrary (pdf)
